## Story

Developers live in a technological world which is continuously changing.
Project switching, technology switching, language switching, a big bunch of switching, don't it?
At dailymotion, we take care of the mental health of our engineers, as they work on over 500+ repositories, developed with more than 50 technological stacks. Therefore we decided to re-think our way to deal with the complexity of our internal codebase.

## Foundation

* A Container runtime as the only dependency on developer's laptop.  
Docker provides a full integration with Mac, Windows & Linux (ubuntu).
* Use generic task names to launch common actions.
* Let developers use the technologies & libraries they want.
* Simplify technical on-boarding.
* Simplify switching between projects.
